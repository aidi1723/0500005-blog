	<p>
		I am not a historian, not a journalist, and not a famous writer. I am an ordinary Chinese
		software engineer born in the 1980s, living in Jinan, trying to keep up with mortgages,
		education, and the small anxieties that come with a changing world.
	</p>

	<p>
		But I have to write these pages.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <strong>Earth Civilization 0.5 Chronicles</strong> is neither a grand world history nor a
		pure memoir. It is an attempt to record the transition from the late mechanical age to the
		digital era, and then to the AI era (1980-2045), using two parallel threads:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Milestones (verifiable):</strong> a small set of checkable events each year (technology,
			science, culture) with dates and names whenever possible.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Daily life (felt):</strong> the texture of ordinary life - appliances, communication,
			entertainment, school, work, family - and how big changes land on real people.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Why "0.5"?</h2>
	<p>
		0.5 means <strong>transition</strong>.
		It is not the ending of the old era, and not the final form of the new one. It is the messy
		middle state where both coexist:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The machines keep running, but information starts flowing.</li>
		<li>The family gathers around a TV, but a network quietly appears behind the screen.</li>
		<li>Experience travels by word of mouth, but knowledge becomes searchable and copyable.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Method: Milestones + Vignettes</h2>
	<p>
		These two threads calibrate each other. Milestones keep the direction correct; vignettes keep
		the temperature real. When I am not sure, I will say so, and I will mark items to verify.
	</p>

	<h2>Point of view</h2>
	<p>
		This chronicle spans 1980-2045, and I do not have equal first-hand memory of every year.
		For early years, I rely on family stories and physical traces (photos, receipts, objects).
		From 1985 onward, it gradually becomes my own lived experience.
	</p>

	<h2>Boundaries</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>I avoid political positioning and focus on technology, culture, economy, and daily life.</li>
		<li>I respect facts: key milestones should be checkable; uncertainty stays visible.</li>
		<li>I respect ordinary people: big changes always end up in specific families and jobs.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Who am I?</h2>
	<p>
		My name is Yang Yu. I was born in 1985 in a small county in Shandong, studied computer science,
		and worked as a software engineer in Jinan for more than a decade. If you remember your first
		radio, your first cassette tape, your first dial-up connection, or your first AI-written draft,
		I hope you will find a shadow of yourself here.
