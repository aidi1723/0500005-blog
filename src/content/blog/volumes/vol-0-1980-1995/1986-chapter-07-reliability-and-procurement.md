## English

In 1986, computing moves from pilots to investment.

Once an organization is willing to pay for procurement and maintenance, computing begins to reshape budgets and management structures. Reliability stops being a technical metric and becomes organizational risk.

Key point: in 1986, computing starts to look like infrastructure that must be governed.
