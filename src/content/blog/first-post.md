This blog documents a single long arc: the transition from the mechanical era to the AI era (1980-2045).

“0.5” is a working name for the in-between phase where old systems still run the world, while new systems quietly rewrite it.

## How posts are structured

- Context: what the world looked like (technology, economy, culture).
- Signals: small events that later became big.
- Mechanisms: why the change happened (not just what happened).
- Artifacts: notes, photos, links, or primary sources when possible.
- Takeaway: what changed in how people worked and lived.

## What to expect next

I will publish chronologically starting from 1980, and occasionally add topic pages (software, manufacturing, media, and everyday life).
