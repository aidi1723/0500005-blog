你读到这里时，世界也许已经换过好几套“操作系统”。

很多人会把过去描述成一条直线：某个伟大发明出现，然后一切加速、增长、胜利。但我所经历和看到的变化，更像一条弯曲的河。旧的东西并不会立刻消失，新的东西也不会一夜成型。大多数时间，我们生活在过渡期里——旧系统仍然运行世界，新系统悄悄改写规则。

我把这段过渡叫作“0.5”。

它不是一个准确的技术名词，而是一种处境：当人类还在沿用机械时代的组织方式与心理习惯，却已经开始被数字系统、网络系统、算法系统、以及最终的 AI 系统重新塑形。

这份记录从 1980 写到 2045。写的是技术，但不是“参数表”；写的是历史，但不是“口号”。它试图回答一个更朴素的问题：当新的工具出现时，人到底是怎么被改变的？

我想留下的不是宏大的结论，而是一套可以被复查的细节：某一年流行的设备与软件，某个行业的工作流程如何变化，某类工厂的工艺如何升级，信息如何传播，组织如何协调，个人如何学习与谋生。很多看似琐碎的东西，恰恰是时代的真实：它们构成了每一个“后来”的前提。

为了让这份记录对你有用，我坚持几条原则。

事实优先。能引用原始材料就尽量引用：照片、说明书、版本号、广告、价格、参数、时间点。无法验证的部分会标注为回忆；推测会标注为推测。我不想用写作的流畅来替代证据的坚硬。

机制解释。我更关心“为什么会这样”，而不是“发生了什么”。同一个技术在不同地区、不同产业链位置，带来的结果可能相反。真正决定结果的往往不是技术本身，而是成本、供给链、制度、教育、媒体、文化偏好这些约束。

大事件与小经验并行。宏观事件会提供骨架：产业升级、互联网普及、移动化、云化、AI 化。微观经验提供血肉：工具如何进入办公室、工厂、学校、家庭，如何改变一个人的工作与生活。时代很少被一个史诗事件推动，更多时候是由无数小步骤堆出来的。

写给未来的人。你不需要我的情绪，你需要清晰：当时的人用什么工具，信息怎么流动，企业怎么组织，个人怎么学会新技能，旧职业如何消失，新职业如何出现。未来回看过去，最稀缺的不是激情，而是可理解的事实与结构。

接下来我会从 1980 开始，按年份推进；同时开辟跨年份的主题线索（个人计算、网络、软件、制造、贸易、媒体、AI），用来串联那些长期的缓慢变化。

这不是一篇文章就能完成的事。它像修一条路：先把路基铺出来，再一段一段加固、扩宽、补标识。

如果你正在未来读这段文字——希望你能从这些碎片里，看见我们曾经如何一步步走到你所在的世界。

By the time you read this, the world may have swapped its “operating system” more than once.

History is often told as a straight road: a great invention arrives, and everything speeds up—progress, growth, triumph. But what I have lived through feels less like a road and more like a river. Old structures do not disappear on schedule. New ones do not arrive complete. Most of the time we live in the overlap—where yesterday still keeps the lights on, while tomorrow quietly rewires the building.

I call that overlap “0.5”.

Not a strict technical term, but a condition: we continue to think and organize ourselves with the reflexes of the mechanical age, even as we are reshaped by digital systems, networked systems, algorithmic systems—and, eventually, AI.

This record runs from 1980 to 2045. It is about technology, but not as a catalog of specifications; it is about history, but not as a string of slogans. It asks a simpler question: when new tools arrive, how do they actually change a life?

I am not trying to leave behind a single grand conclusion. I am trying to leave behind details solid enough to be checked: the devices and software people could actually touch in a given year; the way an industry’s workflow bent, then slowly broke; the way a factory upgraded its craft; the way information moved; the way organizations coordinated; the way a person learned, adapted, and made a living. What looks small is often what makes an era real—the hidden prerequisites of everything that comes later.

To make this record useful, I keep a few rules close.

Facts first. When I can, I will cite primary materials—photos, manuals, version numbers, advertisements, prices, parameters, dates. What cannot be verified will be labeled as memory. What is inference will be labeled as inference. Smooth prose is not a substitute for hard evidence.

Mechanisms over headlines. I care more about why something happened than merely that it happened. The same technology can produce opposite outcomes in different places and different positions along a supply chain. Outcomes are shaped less by the tool itself than by constraints: cost, logistics, institutions, education, media, and the quiet weight of cultural preference.

Big events alongside small experiences. The macro story provides a skeleton—industrial shifts, the spread of the internet, mobile, cloud, AI. The micro story provides flesh: how tools enter offices, factories, schools, homes; how they change the way work is done, and what “ordinary life” even means.

Written for the future. You do not need my emotions; you need clarity: what tools were used, how information traveled, how enterprises were organized, how people learned new skills, how old jobs faded and new jobs appeared. Looking back, what is rare is not passion, but structure that can still be understood.

Next, I will begin with 1980 and move year by year. In parallel, I will keep thematic tracks—personal computing, networks, software, manufacturing, trade, media, AI—threads that can be followed across decades.

This cannot be built in a single essay. It is more like laying a roadbed: first make it passable, then reinforce it, widen it, mark it—section by section.

If you are reading this in the future: may these fragments help you see how we arrived here, one small step at a time.
